Currenly making a Class version of the app with multiple sites which are added already or can be added in the furture. I will manually 
add the sites to scrape the informstion off from. I want to find a way for the code to be self mending be a cool idea dont know if possible
I would like to use trello but i think its a waste of time rather use a whiteboard but i dont understand for project with multip[le people
trello is a good way to show how to comunicate ideas and to explain whats happening.

Adding different websites for scrapping have a whole file dedicated for scrapping and error checks 
keeps things nice and neat althought i may make a class for it think ill have to.


got quite a lot to do, when finished probably put it on chrome/google marketplace or something
